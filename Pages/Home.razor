<h1>Blazor - moment 1.2!</h1>



<p>.NET Razor is a server-side web programming framework developed by Microsoft that offers a powerful and
        user-friendly approach to building dynamic web applications. At its core, Razor allows developers to seamlessly
        integrate C# code within HTML markup, facilitating the creation of dynamic and data-driven web pages.

        With Razor, web developers can embed C# code directly into their HTML templates using the "@@" symbol, allowing
        for the inclusion of variables, expressions, and logic right within the page structure. This approach simplifies
        the development process by eliminating the need for complex context switches between HTML and code, resulting in
        cleaner and more maintainable code.

        Razor also encourages the creation of partial views, which are reusable UI components that can be included in
        multiple pages. This promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy, as developers can encapsulate commonly
        used elements such as navigation menus, headers, and footers in these partial views.

        In addition to traditional web development, Razor has played a crucial role in the evolution of Blazor—a web
        framework for building interactive and real-time web applications using C# and Razor components. With Blazor,
        developers can create rich, single-page applications (SPAs) that run both on the client and server, all while
        utilizing the familiar Razor syntax.

        Integrated development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio provide robust support for Razor, including syntax
        highlighting and IntelliSense, making it even more accessible and productive for developers. This support
        streamlines the coding process and ensures that developers can catch errors and typos in real-time.

        In summary, .NET Razor is a versatile and developer-friendly framework that simplifies web development by
        seamlessly blending HTML markup with C# code. It is widely used in the ASP.NET ecosystem, offering flexibility
        and productivity for web developers, and has evolved to play a significant role in the creation of modern web
        applications, including Blazor-based projects. Its clean and intuitive syntax, along with strong IDE support,
        makes it a valuable tool for building dynamic and interactive web applications.</p>
