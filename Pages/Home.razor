<h1>Blazor - moment 1.2!</h1>



<p>
    Blazor is a web framework developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET ecosystem. It enables developers to build interactive web applications using C# and HTML, with the ability to run code directly in the browser. Blazor offers two hosting models:

    Blazor Server: In this model, the application's logic is executed on the server, and the UI updates are sent to the client over a SignalR connection. This approach provides real-time updates and is suitable for applications with lower client-side requirements.

    Blazor WebAssembly: This model allows you to run Blazor applications directly in the browser using WebAssembly. It provides a more client-centric architecture and enables building Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and fully client-side applications. WebAssembly allows C# code to run at near-native speed in the browser.

    Blazor also supports component-based development, where you can create reusable UI components with their own logic. These components can be shared across different parts of your application. Developers familiar with C# and .NET can leverage their skills to create modern web applications with Blazor, making it a powerful tool for building web applications within the Microsoft technology stack.
